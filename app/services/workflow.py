"""LangGraph-based RAG workflow.

Defines a state-machine workflow with the following stages:
  1. **Rewrite** — optional query rewriting for better retrieval
  2. **Retrieve** — vector search for relevant document chunks
  3. **Judge** — ReAct relevance check; may loop back to retrieve with sub-questions
  4. **Draft** — LLM answer generation with output policy check
  5. **Approval** — optional human-in-the-loop approval
  6. **Final** — pass-through when no approval is required

The graph is compiled once at module level and reused for every request.
